Reasons to study algorithms:

-> Their impact is broad and far-reaching:
From the internet to biology to, commercial computing, computer graphics, security, multimedia, social networks, and
scientific applications, algorithms are all around us. They're used for movies and video games, for particle collision
simulation, they're used to study the genome, and all manner of other applications.

->  Ancient roots, new opportunities
The first algorithm studied goes back to 300 B.C., dating at least to Euclid.
The concept of an algorithm was formalized actually at Princeton, by Church and Turing, in the 1930s.

-> To be able to solve problems that it could not otherwise be addressed (e.g. Network connectivity)- main reason

-> interesting for intellectual stimulation: "An algorithm must be seen to be believed" - Donald Knuth

-> to become a proficient programmer - it's necessary to understand good, efficient algorithms, good data structures.
Linus Torvalds, who created lin, Linux - Bad vs good programmers difference is: "Bad programmers worry about the code,
good programmers worry about data structures, and their relationships" ( and the algorithms that process them).
Niklaus Wirth wrote a famous book called Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

-> They have become a common language for understanding, nature - they might unlock secrets of life or universe.
Algorithms are computational models, and algorithmic models are replacing mathematical models in scientific inquiry.

-> for fun and profit
